# Bookmarker

Bookmarker is a bare-bones system for keeping track of things you want to read or watch. Items added can have a title to help you keep track of them. URL's are required, and when added Bookmarker will attempt to read the website's title and get an image to help you keep track of what you've added to Bookmarker.
